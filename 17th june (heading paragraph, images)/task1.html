    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Playing Chess</h2>
    <p><b>Chess</b> is my favorite hobby because it challenges my mind and sharpens my thinking skills. I enjoy the
        strategy, the complexity, and the satisfaction of executing a perfect plan. Whether I’m playing casually or
        competitively, every game is a new adventure filled with possibilities.</p>

    <p>I often play online on <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/shivang112" target="_blank">my Chess.com profile</a>
        where I compete in various formats like <i>Rapid</i>, <b>Blitz</b>, and <u>Bullet</u>. It’s a great way to
        improve and connect with others who love the game as much as I do.<br><br>
